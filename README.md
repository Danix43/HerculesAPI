# HerculesAPI

Almost a production ready back-end based on String Boot 2 and Tomcat 8 server. This is the first attempt of working with advanced HTTP request and connecting multiple points of data entry.

## Motivation

This project wants to be a connector between an DIY Arduino based weather station and future front-end solutions. While this is now discontinued, it provided and still does a base for non-reactive back-end projects. In future it's posible to pick up HerculesAPI again for future development, but very unlikely.

## Instalation

This need the following to work: 
  - Java 8 or later
  - [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
  - [Spring Boot 2](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
  - [Tomcat 8](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi) - optional - needed because the project ships default by war
